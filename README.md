# Agentic Intent Protocol (AIP) Specification

**Version:** 0.1.0
**Status:** Public Specification
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-13

---

## Overview

The **Agentic Intent Protocol (AIP)** is an open standard for intent monetization in AI-powered and agentic environments. AIP enables platforms, advertisers, and ad networks to participate in a transparent, performance-based advertising ecosystem designed specifically for conversational AI and autonomous agents.

This repository contains the **formal protocol specification**, including:

- **JSON Schemas** - Formal definitions for all protocol entities
- **Documentation** - Complete technical specification across 10 chapters
- **Examples** - Reference implementations of protocol messages
- **Conformance Tests** - Validation suite for protocol compliance

📖 **Full Documentation:** [https://aip.mintlify.app](https://aip.mintlify.app)

---

## Why AIP?

Traditional advertising protocols (OpenRTB, VAST, etc.) were designed for web pages and mobile apps. AIP is purpose-built for:

- **AI Conversations** - Monetize intent expressed in natural language
- **Agentic Environments** - Support autonomous agents making decisions
- **Performance-Based Billing** - Progressive pricing (CPX → CPC → CPA)
- **Transparent Attribution** - Verifiable event tracking and billing

---

## Protocol Features

### Core Capabilities

- ✅ **Real-Time Bidding** - Sub-100ms auction mechanics for contextual recommendations
- ✅ **Progressive Billing** - Three-tier pricing model (CPX, CPC, CPA) with single-charge settlement
- ✅ **Event Verification** - Signed, timestamped events for exposure, click, and conversion tracking
- ✅ **Fraud Prevention** - HMAC signatures, nonce validation, and trust scoring
- ✅ **Privacy-First** - GDPR/CCPA compliant, no PII required for basic operations
- ✅ **Interoperable** - Open standard that any network can implement

### Event Types

| Event Type | Event Name | Trigger | Billing Unit |
|------------|------------|---------|--------------|
| **Exposure** | `cpx_exposure` | User sees an ad or recommendation | Cost per Exposure (CPX) |
| **Click** | `cpc_click` | User clicks or engages with ad | Cost per Click (CPC) |
| **Conversion** | `cpa_conversion` | User completes purchase/signup | Cost per Action (CPA) |

### State Machine

Ledger records transition through states: `PENDING` → `EXPOSED` → `CLICKED` → `CONVERTED` → `FINALIZED`

Only the highest-value event is charged per `serve_token`.

---

## Extension Namespace

AIP supports innovation without fragmentation through a controlled extension namespace. Any operator can add new fields immediately inside a dedicated `ext` object, where their custom parameters live under their own vendor ID. This gives companies full flexibility to experiment, pass proprietary data, or build advanced features without ever touching or breaking the core protocol. If an extension proves useful across the ecosystem, the operator can submit a lightweight RFC, and we evaluate it for inclusion in the next version of AIP. This model keeps the standard stable, predictable, and clean, while allowing rapid evolution on the edges — the same governance pattern used by OpenRTB, OAuth, and Kubernetes.

Each schema defines an optional `ext` container that may include any number of vendor IDs (e.g., `"ext": { "acme.ai": { ... } }`). Operators are expected to document their namespaces and follow the RFC process below to promote broadly useful fields into the core spec.

---

## Platform ↔ Operator Interface

- **`platform-request`** – Payload AI platforms send to operators when a user expresses commercial intent. It captures raw query text, locale/geo, optional conversation history, transport auth, and any vendor extensions under `ext`.
- **`context-request`** – Payload operators send to subscribed brand agents after classifying the opportunity. Operators may derive or redact fields from the originating `platform-request` before fanout.

This split keeps the platform/operator contract stable while allowing operators to enrich or anonymize data before reaching bidders.

## Quick Start

### 1. Explore the Schemas

All protocol entities are defined using [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema):

```bash
# View the CPX exposure event schema
cat schemas/event-cpx-exposure.json

# View the auction result schema
cat schemas/auction-result.json
```

Each schema includes:
- `$id` - Canonical URI for the schema
- `$schema` - JSON Schema version
- `required` - Required fields
- `properties` - Field definitions with types, descriptions, and examples
- `examples` - Complete example payloads

### 2. Validate Against Schemas

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run conformance tests (validates all examples against schemas)
npm test
```

### 3. Read the Specification

## Operating Your Own AIP Specification Fork

The reference `aip-spec` repo is intentionally open so operators can host a public-facing version, adapt it to their network, and still remain compatible with the core protocol. Follow the steps below whenever you want to stand up and maintain your own fork.

### Prerequisites

- GitHub account with permission to create public repositories
- Git 2.40+, Node.js 18+, npm 9+, and Python 3.10+ installed
- Familiarity with JSON Schema, Markdown documentation workflows, and GitHub Pages (or equivalent static hosting)
- Optional: access to a CI system (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc.) for automated conformance checks

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

```bash
gh repo fork admesh-labs/aip-spec --clone --remote
cd aip-spec
git remote add upstream https://github.com/admesh-labs/aip-spec.git
```

Keep `origin` pointing to your fork and `upstream` to the canonical specification.

### 2. Set Up Local Development

```bash
npm ci               # installs schema + doc tooling
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r tools/requirements.txt  # optional helpers
```

Recommended editors: VS Code with JSON Schema validation, Markdown linting, and Spell Right extensions.

### 3. Modify Schemas, Docs, and Examples

- Update JSON Schemas in `schemas/` using Draft 2020-12 syntax; keep `$id` unique to your domain.
- Adjust narrative documentation under `docs/` to describe your network-specific behaviors.
- Refresh payload samples in `examples/` so they remain valid against your schemas.
- Record every spec change in `CHANGELOG.md` and increment the version noted at the top of this README.

### 4. Run Conformance & Validation

```bash
npm test                       # runs ./tests manifests against schemas
npm run lint:docs              # optional lint check if defined
node scripts/validate-links.mjs # ensure docs cross-links resolve
```

Only publish changes that pass the full suite. For custom extensions, add coverage in `tests/valid` and `tests/invalid` to document expected behavior.

### 5. Publish Your Specification

**GitHub Pages** (recommended):

1. Enable Pages on your fork (Settings → Pages → Deploy from GitHub Actions).
2. Add a workflow that runs Mintlify (or another static doc generator) pointing at your fork.
3. Map a custom domain (e.g., `spec.your-network.com`) via DNS `CNAME` record.

**Custom Hosting:**

- Export the Markdown/HTML bundle and deploy to any static host (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, S3 + CloudFront, etc.).
- Mirror the raw JSON Schemas at stable URLs so integrators can reference them via `$id`.

### 6. Stay Compatible with Upstream

- Pull upstream changes regularly:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

- Resolve conflicts carefully; prioritize upstream transport/security rules over local overrides.
- Keep shared namespaces (`$id`, event types, ledger states) aligned unless you intentionally version them differently.

### 7. Version Custom Extensions

- Use semantic versioning with a vendor suffix, e.g., `1.0.0-my-network.1`.
- Document every extension in `docs/10-versioning-and-conformance.md` under a dedicated "Vendor Extensions" heading.
- Provide migration notes so bidders know how your fork differs from the base protocol.

### 8. Contribute Back

- When fixes or enhancements are generalizable, open a PR against `admesh-labs/aip-spec`.
- Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` (linting, commit style, CLA checks) before submitting.
- Reference your fork’s issues or deployments so reviewers can validate the change in context.

By following this workflow you can safely innovate on top of AIP while ensuring interoperability with the core protocol and the broader bidder ecosystem.
