# 04 · Auction

Each auction is initiated by a context request, followed by bid submissions, and culminates in a clearing decision.

1. **Context Request:** Defines the opportunity, constraints, and accountability metadata.
2. **Bid Submission:** Bidders respond with price, creative payload, and signals.
3. **Result Emission:** The clearinghouse communicates the winning bid, price, and settlement token.

Tie-breaking, pacing, and experimental arms are all codified within this chapter to ensure deterministic behavior.

## Asynchronous Auction Window & Selective Distribution

The AIP bidding model uses a **time-bounded asynchronous auction window** rather than full broadcast fanout. AI platforms submit a `platform_request` (Section 04.1) to the operator, who classifies the opportunity and derives the `context_request` that is distributed to subscribed brand agents. Only agents that have explicitly subscribed to the resulting category pools receive the context. Distribution to bidders is handled through a cloud-agnostic **publish/subscribe transport**, starting with Google Pub/Sub in v1.0 and extendable to AWS SNS/SQS, Azure Event Grid, Kafka, or other message buses. After publishing the context, the AIP Server opens a short **auction window** (typically 30–70 ms) during which bidders may submit signed bids via `POST /aip/bid-response`. When the window closes, the server collects all bids received within the allowed timeframe, applies the AIP selection rules (CPA > CPC > CPX), and returns the `auction_result` to the platform. If no bids are received before the window expires, the server returns a valid `no_bid` response. This design enables scalable, category-aware bidding, minimizes latency, prevents unnecessary bidder fanout, and ensures that only relevant brand agents compete for each user intent.

## 04.1 PlatformRequest → ContextRequest

| Stage | Schema | Audience | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ingress | `platform-request` | AI Platform → Operator | Raw user intent, safety context, and transport auth. |
| Fanout | `context-request` | Operator → Brand Agents | Normalized context with pool classification and any operator annotations. |

Operators MAY redact, enrich, or reformat data between the two payloads. Vendor-specific metadata MUST live inside the `ext.<vendor_id>` namespace to avoid collisions and to simplify future promotions into the core spec.
